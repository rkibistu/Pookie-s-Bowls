# Issue tracker: Local Markdown (`tasks/`)

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `tasks/`. Only open work sits directly in `tasks/`; finished work is moved to `tasks/completed/`.

## Conventions

- A standalone task is a single flat file: `tasks/<slug>.md` (snake_case, e.g. `better_recipe_page.md`)
- A feature that is broken into tickets gets a directory: `tasks/<feature-slug>/`
  - The spec is `tasks/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
  - Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `tasks/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading
- **Done**: when a task is finished, move its file into `tasks/completed/`. When every ticket of a feature is finished, move the whole `tasks/<feature-slug>/` directory into `tasks/completed/`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `tasks/` (a flat `tasks/<slug>.md` for a single task, or under `tasks/<feature-slug>/` for a spec and its tickets, creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path (check `tasks/completed/` too if it isn't in `tasks/`). The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `tasks/<effort>/map.md` (the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body).
- **Child ticket**: `tasks/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `tasks/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
